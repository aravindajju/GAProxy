Google Analytics needs JavaScript to track the site activity.  However, this
not ideal for sites, where one might not have full control.  For example,
in a corporate blog or in a forum, user will not the have necessary control insert GA
JavaScript to the page.  GA Proxy can be used in these cases.

GAProxy builds the Google Analytics __utm.gif url with sensible defaults
and can be deployed in Google App Engine.   Once deployed in the app engine,
GAProxy can be used as an image tracker URL, which can be placed on any web page.

Usage Instructions:

<img src=http://<appid>.appspot.com/gaproxy?host=<hostname.com>&pageurl=<url of page>&account=<GA site id eg., UA-12345> />
